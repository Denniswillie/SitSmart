# SitSmart

## About
This project is a smart hot desking system. It allows users to book based on their preferences. Currently, these "preferences" include **air quality**, **noisiness**, and **temperature levels**. Users are able to book the desks from the booking website.<br/><br/>
This project integrates the software components with IoT components (sensors and Raspberry Pi) to be able to get the environment data of the desks.

## Architecture
![Technical Architecture](https://i.ibb.co/1XqVznD/Use-case-diagram-9.png)
### Hardware
For the hardware component, we are using the following sub-components:
1. SGP30 CO2 sensor
2. DHT11 temperature sensor
3. LM386 sound sensor
4. 10k Ohm resistor
5. Raspberry Pi
6. Breadboard
7. Jumper wires
### Backend
AWS EC2 instance (with Nginx as the web server and MySQL as the database server).
### DNS
AWS Route 53
### Email Service
Amazon SES
### PubSub
For the publisher-subscriber component, we're using PubNub. 

## Running on local machine
### Server and Database (Backend)
1. open terminal
2. `git clone https://github.com/Denniswillie/SitSmart.git <folderName>`
3. `cd <folderName>`
4. Create Python virtual environment and load pip dependencies:
     - `python -m venv venv` (if `python` doesn't automatically refer to python 3, use `python3` instead, same for all usages of `python` below.)
     - `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
     - `pip install flask flask-cors flask-session flask-mysqldb authlib python-dotenv pubnub flask-mail`
5. Turn on `Apache` and `MySql` on xampp control panel.
6. Create a database for the project on a local MySQL server. (below is a guide if you're using terminal)
     - `mysql -u root` if you haven't set a password, otherwise, `mysql -u root -p`. It will prompt you to enter a password.
     - `CREATE DATABASE <your_database_name>;`
     - `use <your_database_name>;`
     - copy the content of `database.sql` (the whole file) and paste it in the mysql console, press enter.
     - `exit`
7. Setup PubNub account, turn on access manager. Below is a short guide on how to set it up:
     - Create a PubNub account if you haven't.
     - Once logged in, click `Apps` on side navigation bar
     - Click `Create New App` and then enter the name of the new app
     - Click the newly created app
     - In the Configuration panel, turn on access manager.
8. [Setup Google Client ID and client secret](https://www.balbooa.com/gridbox-documentation/how-to-get-google-client-id-and-client-secret)
9. Create a file called `.env` like below: (replace all occurrences of `<...>` with the appropriate values)
```
MYSQL_HOST=<mysql_host_name>
MYSQL_USER=<mysql_user>
MYSQL_PASSWORD=<mysql_password>
MYSQL_DB=<your_database_name>
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=<mail_default_sender>
MAIL_PASSWORD=<mail_password>
MAIL_USERNAME=<mail_username>
PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY=<pubnub_publish_key>
PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY=<pubnub_subscribe_key>
PUBNUB_SECRET_KEY=<pubnub_secret_key>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<google_client_id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<google_client_secret>
REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5000/authorize
```
8. `python app.py` (make sure to run it in `<folderName>`
9. Go to [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:5000). You should see the SitSmart's start screen.

### Sensors and Raspberry Pi (Hardware)
_This part assumes that:_
<br/>
_1. The Raspberry Pi is already connected to the internet. Make sure your network allows communications using PubNub._
<br/>
_2. You have already setup a PubNub account_
<br/>
_3. The server is running (i.e. ready to receive PubNub messages sent by `sensors.py`)_
<br/>
If all the steps above has already been completed, let's get into the "meat" of this section.
1. Wire the components as shown in the diagram below.
![Fritzing Diagram](https://i.ibb.co/DY9N5Cz/unknown.png)
2. Open terminal on Raspberry Pi
3. `git clone https://github.com/Denniswillie/SitSmart.git <folderName>` (we will need `sensors.py` and `admin_program.py`)
4. [Enable I2C](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/11/enabling-the-i2c-interface-on-the-raspberry-pi/)
