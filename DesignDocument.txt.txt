Ensuring Device Security

To ensure our device security. First, we will get every device’s mac address and store it in the database 
called “Device Authentication”. Secondly, we will set a strong password to secure the database to make 
sure the database is safe. After that, if any device’s mac address is outside of our network and tried to 
access our device. Our system will find that device’s mac address and compare it by using the registered mac 
address list from the database. If the mac address is not on the list, then the system will notify us to remove the unknown device .
