Introduction 

 

Sit Smart is a smart study space reservation system using IOT technology. The system is being developed by Team Think and consists of a website and a smart “Desk Kit”, the latter of which consists of a Raspberry Pi and 3 GPIO sensors. The website facilitates booking and the Desk Kit enables check-in, while also accumulating data about the study environment specific to that desk via the sensors, which enables users to make better-informed decisions during the booking process.
